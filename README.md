Credit Card Fraud Detection:

Overview:
  Credit card fraud detection using machine learning is an innovative approach that leverages computational techniques to analyze and interpret transaction data, assisting in the early identification and prevention of fraudulent activities. This project focuses on employing machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate based on a set of transaction-related features.

Objective:
  The primary goal of this project is to contribute to the prevention of credit card fraud by enabling timely detection and intervention. By utilizing historical transaction data, the machine learning model aims to learn patterns and relationships within the data, allowing it to accurately classify transactions and identify fraudulent ones.

Dataset:
  The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset that includes relevant transaction features and labels indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. The dataset is a crucial component in training and evaluating the machine learning model. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection

Data Preprocessing:
  Prior to model training, the dataset undergoes a thorough preprocessing phase. This involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and performing any other necessary steps to ensure the data is suitable for training a machine learning model.

Libraries:
  The following libraries were used in this project:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
sklearn
matplotlib

Machine Learning Model:
  The machine learning models employed in this project are:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
The choice of model depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the fraud detection task.

Training:
  The model is trained on a subset of the dataset, where it learns to recognize patterns and relationships between input features and transaction outcomes. During the training phase, hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the model's performance.

  Evaluation:
To assess the model's effectiveness, various evaluation metrics are used. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.
